    I'am so proud, this stupid function of mine (total newbie) inspired IQ.
    He updated his page about 2D distance functions after my publishing ! 
    This pushed me to find more distance functions, on spirals, helix ... 
    And I found it very fun.

    **Was very happy with this one**.
    I modelled the rocket for the first time with IQ's SDFs, without even understanding how the ligthing is working.
    Added a BigWings tutorial starfield background. 
    Tried also a glow effect. 
    Newbies can dare all.

    **tuto** about polar repetition. 
    I think this transformation is missing the the IQ page about distance functions. 
    But this is mentioned in one of his video tutorial.
