    I'am so proud, this stupid function of mine (total newbie) inspired IQ.
    He updated his page about 2D distance functions after my publishing ! 
    This pushed me to find more distance functions, on spirals, helix ... 
    And I found it very fun.

    **Was very happy with this one**.
    I modelled the rocket for the first time with IQ's SDFs, without even understanding how the ligthing is working.
    Added a BigWings tutorial starfield background. 
    Tried also a glow effect. 
    Newbies can dare all.

    **tuto** about polar repetition. 
    I think this transformation is missing the the IQ page about distance functions. 
    But this is mentioned in one of his video tutorial.

    After working on polar repetition again. 
    There is instructions for newbies to change and make variations of the code.

    After studying IQ's joint functions based on a set of capped torus, 
    and BigWings 2D shaders technics (smiley face youtube tutorials). 
    I had fun testing the results of diffrents procedural patterns from Shane.
    I spent time to work on the amination.

    After searching for archimedian spiral functions. 
    Fun to see that many comments were about the twisted cylinders wrapped around the spiral, 
    much simplier to get.

    On this one I played with the 3D fonts and the transparent effect. 
    There is also a may be too serious message. 
    It's a risk to have to fight against some Anti-vax militants.

    The 'Helicoid' shape is too complicated for me,
    more than the Archimedian spiral, 
    The distance function is not good enough.

    Very quickly done, based on a BigWings post about domain repetition.
    The result is nice ! 
    I spent a long time to watch it, 
    I think the humain brain is wired to catch Eggs.

    I started by trying to replicate the map of my dinner room 
    that has some bee pattern on it, and this ended with this.
