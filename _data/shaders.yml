    Contruction of polyhedrons based on reflextions, perfect to be used in a shader. It's based on repeated reflexions regarding 3 plans, not really easy to me to visualize the construction. The numbers refers to the fractions of angles on the triangular tiles and the pipe sign the position of the point to use as vertex to the polyhedra. **interested**
