# What it is

I had the change to have as a child a "scorpius slider spider puzzle"

I learnt on [This page](https://www.lairdubois.fr/creations/14279-le-scorpius.html) that it's a quite rare and difficult to produce puzzle.

I spend some time trying to reproduce the shape on Shadertoy, and understand what is the geometry behind.

# The Dihedrial angle problem

What fascinated me is the angle needed to bend each lille piece when connecting them.

It's 70 degres, but from where this value is coming from ?  
All pieces have a triangular section, with angles 30, 60 and 90 degres, but at the end they are all connected with a symetry of 90 degres around a central point.
