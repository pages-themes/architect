In March 2020, the COVID made me having more time to search about creative coding.


And in fact I discovered more than I expected !
* This site started from the very generous idea of **"Create and Share your best shaders with the world and find Inspiration"**. It's a place to watch small pieces of **GLSL** code generating awesome images. 
* I (re)discovered the **demoscene** and their community very active on Shadertoy.
* I **discovered** with Shadertoy **the ray marching** algorithm that allows to build real time realistic 3D scenes "without any Maya or Blender or something", just your keyboard, some calculations on a paper sheet and knownlege of how to make a "for" loop. 
* I discovered Computer Graphic professionals, working for the Cinema or for the Video Game industry or greats scientists working in LABs in image and video processing.
* In fact I discovered a full domain I had no idea of.


I should say that is was a BIG shock for me to discover the power of the fragment shaders, procedural rendering and the massive parallelism of the moderm graphic cards. I was crazy about it.
The last time I made real time graphics was while programming the Motorola 68000 at 8Mhz of my ATARI 520 ST, trying to draw some pixels on the 320x200 16 colors screen, with 512 KB of RAM. 
It was like jumping in a time machine for me to discover that shaders uses now high precision floats instead of integers, that fragment shaders runs using GPU massive parallelism, buffers and memory are not a problem, all is 1 million time faster !
And you can do it online with few lines of code in your browser with Shadertoy !

What is special with Shadertoy is the **community**, animated by IQ and other big contributors. They are present on the site to comment the newly  published shaders, and it's really cool. 
The facebook and Twitter community is also very active. There is a Discord server.
The technical limitations introduced by the GLSL language also avoid to have a too large creations. 
For example building a complete game is very painfull and a true challenge. 
For this, the published shaders are mainly simple, few line of code, centered on procedurals technics, performance tricks aesthetic and colors.
The **ergonomy** of the site is also great, with Alt+ENTER shortcut to compile in a second and see the results, making possible to spend hours making a step by step improvements to your art work until to reach the perfection !
