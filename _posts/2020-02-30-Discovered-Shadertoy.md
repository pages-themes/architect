In March 2020, the COVID made me having more time to search about creative coding.

And in fact I discovered more than I expected !

* I (re)discovered the **demoscene** and their community very active on Shadertoy.
* I **discovered** with Shadertoy **the ray marching** algorithm that allows to build real time realistic 3D scenes "without any Maya or Blender or something", just your keyboard, some calculations on a paper sheet and knownlege of how to make a "for" loop. 
* My vision is that this site started from the very generous idea of **"Create and Share your best shaders with the world and find Inspiration"**. It's a place to watch small pieces of **GLSL** code generating awesome images. It's so rare today to find people driven only by their passion.
