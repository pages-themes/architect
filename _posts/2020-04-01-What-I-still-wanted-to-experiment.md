## My motivations

Making shaders is like cooking, we try to impress and make me happy and also people watching at it. This is my first motivation.

## I am and will still be an hobbyist, not a professional !

* I'am able to create a ray marching shader (based on BigWings template)
    * Modelling with SDF
    * Simple lightning
    * Basic textures
* I'am able to create 2D shaders
* I know how to make a transparent objet using multiple rendering pass.
* Have to experiment with noise.
* Have to learn about fluid simulations
* Have to learn about volumetric clouds
* Have to learn about terrain rendering
* Have to learn about cell shading
* To be continued.

I want probably make another shader related more to geomery than modelling, especially methods for having more domain repetition methods. There is many topics possibles.
