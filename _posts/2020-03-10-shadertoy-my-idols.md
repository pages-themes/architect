Mainly the spirit of Shadertoy is closely related to the **demoscene**. Looking at Wikipedia you will have a good explanation of what it is. 

In resume, these guys are triying to make cool things with their computers. 

I follow some smart guys on Shadertoy. 
Below my naive "groupie" comments about them !
