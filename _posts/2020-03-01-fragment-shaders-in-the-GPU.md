Here I have to put some usefull links that explains how your programm is executed in parallel for each single pixel on the screen.
This is very important to understand the theory before coding anything or you will fall in big performance issues.
* Technical explanation in details ! [How GPU works](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15462-f12/www/lec_slides/462_gpus.pdf)
* [thebookofshaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/01/?lan=fr)
* [the graphics codex](http://graphicscodex.com/)
To start learning about the rendering equation and physically based rendering.
then, dive into [PBRT](http://www.pbr-book.org/)
