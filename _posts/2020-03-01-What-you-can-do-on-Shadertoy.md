**Generative art** is all what Shadertoy is about. I think this video explains quite well what it is.
[Tim Holman - Generative Art Speedrun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Se0_w0ISYk)

As this Three.js [page](https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-shadertoy.html) explains very well, you will not here develop a full 3D application, but short GLSL programs for fun or to experiment and learn about 3D rendering technics.

I can see shaders in the following main categories (personal point of view)
* Masterpieces
    * Here the creator tries to sum of many different technics in the same shader. Need weeks of work. The creator wants to prove and show his artistic and technical skills.
* Nice Illustrations of functions and algorithms
    * Tutorial, here the creator wants to make a visualisation of what he learnt and wants to communicate, like construction of polyhedrons or the rendering of clouds.
* Reproduction
    * The author tries to reproduce a picture, or a scene of a movie for example, for the pleasure.
* Golfing
    * Making very short program, the pleasure is to find how its works with so few characters !
* VJing (Video Jockey) 
    * Some shaders like spychedelic fractals may be used during "parties".
* Results of live coding parties. 
    * Memorize some formulas and retype them quickly, you will impress your audience.
* Playable games and emulators
    * No idea how they can even do it !
* Optical illusions 
    * Fun ! But be prepared for headhatches if you look at it too long.
