I like the community of Shadertoy, so even if more featured sites may exist, there is no better place for me today than Shadertoy to post a shader !

Below alternative sites I noticed

* https://smoothstep.io/
    * Allow to make animations, ready to use templates available. Focus on animation.
* https://www.vertexshaderart.com/
    * To learn about verted Shaders in GLSL, the sound texture offers a lot of possibilities.
* https://neort.io/popular
    * Digital artists can demonstrate their skills.
