All started with the **Coding Train** and David Shiftman's tutorials. 

The P5.js online editor is great for starting some animations an you can make cools things easyly. 
The subject I used are my son's school drawings about emotions. I scanned and underlined using Inkscape to get an SVG format image. 
Later I was able to add a fire effect shader for the backgroud thanks to shadertoy contributors.

Below another site where you can share your programs but not so much community. 
I pulished one that was using the fire shader, but unfortunately get no feedbacks from the community. 
The web site is also a too confusing.
