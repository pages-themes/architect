I had the idea to study the shape of the Helix, there is many examples of it on Shadertoy.

I have an idea seems fun to make a scytale ! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytale

These can be found [searching using the helix keyword](https://www.shadertoy.com/results?query=helix&sort=popular&from=24&num=12)
